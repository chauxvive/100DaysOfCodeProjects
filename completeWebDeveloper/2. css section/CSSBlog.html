        <h1>This is another article</h1>
        <p>Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular
            gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes with
            it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit.</p>
        <p>Your bones don't break, mine do. That's clear. Your cells react to bacteria and viruses differently than
            mine. You don't get sick, I do. That's also clear. But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way
            to water. We swallow it too fast, we choke. We get some in our lungs, we drown. However unreal it may seem,
            we are connected, you and I. We're on the same curve, just on opposite ends.</p>
        <p>Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed
            on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical
            helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, that's what you see at a toy store. And you
            must think you're in a toy store, because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb.</p>

        <h1>But wait, there's more...</h1>
        <p>Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff. It's art! A statement on modern society,
            'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! You've swallowed a planet! You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's
            going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better?</p>
        <p>The way I see it, every life is a pile of good things and bad things.…hey.…the good things don't always
            soften the bad things; but vice-versa the bad things don't necessarily spoil the good things and make them
            unimportant. You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME!</p>
        <p>You hit me with a cricket bat. Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. They're
            not aliens, they're Earth…liens! I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me
            the Doctor too. I still don't know why.</p>
